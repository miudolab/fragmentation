All scripts are written in R and can be run independently in the R environment.

1. figura_fragmentos.R: Script used to generate a figure showing the spatial distribution of habitat fragments across the landscape.

2. figura_fragmentos_ensemble.R: Script used to generate a dataset in which the mean shortest distance to the nearest fragment is calculated for all fragments in an L x L simulated landscape containing H habitat cells (n = 100 simulations).

3. Fragmentacao.xlsx: Data generated by the simulations and used to produce Figure 2.

Updates to the code will be available at: https://github.com/miudolab/fragmentation
