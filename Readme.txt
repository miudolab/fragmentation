Repository description

This repository contains the files used to generate Figure 2 of the study:

Cazetta, E., and P. R. Guimarães. The disruption of seed dispersal networks: disentangling the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Oikos (in press), DOI: OIK-12049.

R scripts were developed by Paulo R. Guimarães Jr.

Files (please refer to the log list at the end of this document before downloading or using the files):

figura_fragmentos.R
Script used to generate a figure showing the spatial distribution of habitat fragments across the landscape.

figura_fragmentos_ensemble.R
Script used to generate a dataset in which the mean shortest distance to the nearest fragment is calculated for all fragments in an L × L simulated landscape containing H habitat cells (n = 100 simulations).

Fragmentacao.xlsx
Data generated by the simulations and used to produce Figure 2.

Updates to the code will be available at:

Log lists:

2025/02/16 - Please note the R-codes are designed to generate fragmented landscapes. If, however, the amount of habitat and the number of fragments is too high, the simulation will break down. A warning will inform that not all fragments reach designed fragment sizes. I suggest to simulate landscapes with < 40% of habitat amount.
 
2025/02/16 - All scripts are written in R and can be run independently in the R environment. Original codes were commented in Brazilian Portuguese, I added comments in English to help the reader.
