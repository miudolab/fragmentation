# Fragmentation
R codes for the generation of fragmented habitat landscapes

1) figura_fragmentos: a code to generate a figure with the habitat fragments distributed across the landscape.
2) figura_fragmentos_ensemble: a code to generate a file in which the mean shortest distance to the nearest fragment is computed to all fragments in a LxL simulated landscape with H habitat cells (n = 100 simulations).
